# Hackathon v20-1
Cross Browser Testing.\
Applitools Hackathon

The next table compares some attributes to consider while choosing between 
a traditional or modern approach.

| Attribute| Traditional | Modern |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| QA Seniority require | Semi Senior | Junior |
| Maintainability | Low | High |
| Running Time | 183 secs | 97 secs |
| Code Lines | 885 | 248 |
| # Locators | 37 | 5 |
| Complexity | High | Low |
| Spent time | 84h | 3h |

### *Likes about the modern approach with Applitools* 😍
- Super easy to implement tests.
- Saves a lot of time in the test design and execution, this leads to save money.
- Test maintenance is almost null.
- The Issues report is very easy to do, is made up of text and an image that helps to understand it.

## Starting 🚀

### *WebDriver Factory* 🏭
In the traditional testing methods apply the Factory Pattern. 
Eviting problems while designing the automated tests, these 
design patterns could immediately help by proving a formula /
template & saves a lot of time and effort.

### *Data Driven* 📂
Traditional cross browsing tests must have parameters as the 
browser type. For that reason, instructed TestNG to pass you 
the browser type with the `@Parameters` annotation and a testng.xml file.

### *Page Object* 📃
Page Object pattern was used for the test implementation which
 goal was to model the pages and their behaviors to achieve clear
  test of writing, understanding, avoid duplicate code, and easy
   to maintenance.
